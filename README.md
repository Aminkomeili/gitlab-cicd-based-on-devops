# GitLab CI/CD Configuration

This repository contains the configuration file (gitlab-ci.yml) for GitLab CI/CD. The gitlab-ci.yml file specifies the stages and jobs to run during the CI/CD pipeline.
Stages

There are five stages in the pipeline:

1. Test: runs unit tests and generates a coverage report.
2. Build: creates a distribution package (a tarball and a wheel).
3. Deploy: deploys the code to production (only when changes are pushed to the master branch).
4. Pages: creates a simple "Hello, World!" page and deploys it to GitLab Pages (only when changes are pushed to the master branch).
5. Release: creates a Docker image, tags it, and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry (only when a tag is pushed).

## Jobs

Here is a list of the jobs that run in each stage:
Test

The test job installs the required dependencies, runs the unit tests, and generates a coverage report. The coverage report is stored as an artifact, which can be downloaded and viewed later.
## Build

The build job installs the required dependencies and creates a distribution package (a tarball and a wheel) of the project. The distribution package is stored as an artifact, which can be downloaded and used to install the project on other machines.
## Deploy

The deploy job installs the required dependencies and deploys the code to production. This job only runs when changes are pushed to the master branch.
## Pages

The pages job creates a simple "Hello, World!" page and deploys it to GitLab Pages. This job only runs when changes are pushed to the master branch.
## Release

The release job creates a Docker image, tags it, and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry. This job only runs when a tag is pushed.
## Upload

The upload job installs the required dependencies and uploads the distribution package (tarball and wheel) to PyPI using Twine. This job only runs when a tag is pushed.
## Conclusion

This GitLab CI/CD configuration file defines a pipeline that runs the tests, builds a distribution package, deploys the code to production, creates a simple page and deploys it to GitLab Pages, creates a Docker image and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry, and uploads the distribution package to PyPI. This file can be customized to suit your specific needs.
